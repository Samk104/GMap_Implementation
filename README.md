Directions to use this project:
1. On opening, the map automatically zooms in to San Francisco area by default as this is the area containing the markers for places.

2. The app should display clustered markers for bicycle shops throughout the San Fransico area, the icons for these are set to a bicycler. When the map is zoomed out, it displays numbers which are actually clusters representing the number of bicycle shops around there. When zoomed in, these clusters split up into different bicycle outsets.

3. When the map is moved around, the transparency of the icons changes automatically. Whenever a bicycle icon is clicked the map displays a dialog box containing the information about the bicycle outlet including its name, address and rating. Clicking on the bicycle icon also displays a circle around it.

4. Move the map around and click a few icons to see the details as described above.
